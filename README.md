## Why YouTube Summariser

<ul>For many videos, the main content of the videos is only 50-60% of the total length.</ul>

<ul>Youtube summarizer will summarize the content of the video by keeping all the important points and making it short and easily understandable.</ul>

<ul>Summarizing transcripts of such videos automatically allows us to quickly look out for the important patterns in the video and helps us to save time and efforts to go through the whole content of the video.</ul>
